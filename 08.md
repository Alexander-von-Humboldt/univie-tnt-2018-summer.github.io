title: Text Markup ([TEI] XML)…
subtitle: ... and how to remove it …
---

# Goals:

To learn about 1) basic principles of the XML (*eXtensible Markup Language*) and its flavors (mainly, TEI), as well as its advantages and disadvantages; 2) ways of manipulating data in this format.

# Software & Technologies:

* `python` (simple scripting, regular expressions, batch processing)
* XML  


# Class:

## The Essence

``` xml
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```

## XML & HTML

(**NB**: Not an exhaustive list, but rather a nudge to get you thinking in the right direction; *for more:* <http://www.xmlobjective.com/what-is-the-difference-between-xml-and-html/>)

* XML was designed to carry data—with focus on what data is
* HTML was designed to display data—with focus on how data looks
* XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

## DOM (Document Object Model)

``` html
<TABLE>
    <TBODY> 
        <TR> 
            <TD>Shady Grove</TD>
            <TD>Aeolian</TD> 
        </TR> 
        <TR>
            <TD>Over the River, Charlie</TD>        
            <TD>Dorian</TD> 
        </TR> 
    </TBODY>
</TABLE>
```

(more on DOM: <https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html>)

* If you have a well-formed XML/HTML document, you can use DOM to interact with the data in your file (for more on this, see additional tutorials in *Reference materials* on `Beautiful Soup` and `XSL(T)`)
* If you do not (a more real-life story), you need to use a different approach.

## Looking for relevant patterns in file structure

* identify patterns around relevant data
* extract/split with `regular expressions` and a python script
* convert into a clean test or simpler/more consistent format 

## Python code elements for the task

### Regular Expressions Examples

``` python 
import re

text0 = """
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
"""

# EXAMPLE 1 - find/replace

text = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", text0)

print(text)


# EXAMPLE 2 - split

results = re.split("</[^<]+>", text0)

for r in results:
    print(r)

print(results)


# EXAMPLE 3 - capture

text = re.search(r"<from>([^<]+)</from>", text0).group(1)

print(text)

```

### `Open`/`Save` a file

``` python
with open(fileName, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
    data = f1.read()
    ...
    # dataNew = [transformations of data]
    ...
    newFileName = fileName + "_modified.xml"
    with open(newFileName, "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:
        f9.write(dataNew)
```

### Getting all files form a folder

``` python
import os
liftOfFiles = os.listdir(pathToFolder)
```

### Magic Loop

``` python
for f in lof:
    print(f) # for just a fileName
    print(pathToFolder+f) # for full path
```

# Homework:

1. Cleaning the “Dispatch”:
	- write a python script that will create clean copies of text from each issue of the “Dispatch” that you scraped before (make sure to keep the originals intact!).
	- write a python script that will create clean copies of articles (!) from all issues of the “Dispatch”. (again, make sure to keep the originals intact!).
2. Publish an annotated text of your script on your website as a blogpost.
3. Codecademy’s Learn Python, Unit 9-10.
4. Github: publish the confirmation screenshot as a post on your new site.
