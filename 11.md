# SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION


# Reference Materials:

* Frequency list: Turkel, William J., and Adam Crymble. 2012. “Counting Word Frequencies with Python.” Programming Historian, July. <https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/counting-frequencies>.
* Creating cartograms with R: <https://maximromanov.github.io/2015/04-02.html>

# Homework (1/2 and 2/2):

1. GISting the “Dispatch” II: Mapping geographical data from the “Dispatch”
    * Extract toponyms (place names) from the “Dispatch” (python)
    * Calculate their frequencies (python)
    * Add coordinates to those places (QGIS/python)
        * *Hint*: you can create two lists 1) one with place names and their frequencies, 2) with place names and their coordinates; after that, you can merge them with python and generate a CSV file (placename, timeParameter, latitude, longitude, frequency) which can be used for creating a map in QGIS 
    * Map them in QGIS, using frequencies to size the markers on the map
2. Describe the process in a blogpost and publish on your website (including screenshots).
