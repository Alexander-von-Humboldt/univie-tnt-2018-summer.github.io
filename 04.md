# Homework

* Convert a plain text paper into markdown and convert it with Pandoc into a PDF, MS Word, and HTML documents.
	* Plain text file for the task: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maximromanov/tnt_wien_spring2018/master/01/McCarty_Modeling.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maximromanov/tnt_wien_spring2018/master/01/McCarty_Modeling.txt)
	* Use this PDF file as a guide for your formatting: [https://github.com/maximromanov/tnt_wien_spring2018/raw/master/01/McCarty_Modeling.pdf](https://github.com/maximromanov/tnt_wien_spring2018/raw/master/01/McCarty_Modeling.pdf) 
	* Bibliography: you should already have the bibliography for this text collected; you now simply need to export all the records from Zotero into BibTeX format, which works with markdown and pandoc.
	* Convert only the first 7 pages! You can skip up to 1/3 of bibliographical records, if you cannot find them online.
	* Alternatively, you can use excerpts from any of your papers: 7 pages minimum, 15 footnotes, 10 bibliography items. 
* Github: publish HTML version on your website as a blogpost, with links to PDF and MS Word versions.
* Codecademy’s *Learn Python, Unit 1-2*.
* Github: publish the confirmation screenshot as a post on your new site.
